    <h2>How Couples Counseling Works</h2>
    <p>Couples counseling typically begins with an initial assessment where the therapist learns about the relationship dynamics and the issues you wish to address. From there, the therapist works with both partners to create a customized approach, focusing on open communication, understanding, and problem-solving. Sessions are often weekly or bi-weekly and last 50 minutes each.</p>
