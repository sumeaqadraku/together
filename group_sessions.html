      <h2>How Group Therapy Works</h2><br>
      <p>Group therapy sessions typically consist of 6–12 members and are led by a licensed therapist who facilitates discussions and activities. Each session lasts about 60–90 minutes and may focus on specific themes, such as emotional regulation, relationship dynamics, or coping strategies. While participants share their stories and insights, the therapist provides guidance to foster a supportive and productive environment. Sessions can be held weekly or bi-weekly, depending on the group’s needs.</p>
